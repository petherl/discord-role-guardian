# Deployment Guide for Discord Role Guardian Bot

This guide explains how to deploy your bot to Railway.app and monitor it with UptimeRobot for 24/7 uptime.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Railway.app account (free tier available)
- UptimeRobot account (free tier available)
- Your Discord bot token and client ID

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your code
git commit -m "Initial commit: Discord Role Guardian Bot"

# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/nayandas69/discord-role-guardian.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway.app

Railway.app provides free hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub.

### Setup Railway:

1. Go to https://railway.app and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `discord-role-guardian` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect Node.js and deploy

### Add Environment Variables:

1. In Railway dashboard, click on your project
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Add these environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
   - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Discord bot client ID
   - `DATA_PATH`: `/app/data` (for Railway Volume)
   - `PORT`: Leave empty (Railway auto-assigns)

4. Click "Deploy" to restart with new variables

### **IMPORTANT: Setup Railway Volume for Persistent Storage**

This is the most critical step to ensure your bot configurations survive restarts!

1. **In Railway dashboard**, click on your bot service
2. **Go to "Volumes" section** (in the left sidebar)
3. **Click "New Volume"**
4. **Configure the volume:**
   - **Mount Path**: `/app/data`
   - **Name**: `bot-persistent-storage` (or any name you prefer)
5. **Click "Add"**
6. **Redeploy your service** (Railway will do this automatically)

**What this does:**
- Creates permanent storage that survives container restarts
- Your `data/config.json` file persists forever
- No need to reconfigure bot after Railway updates
- Configurations survive deployments, crashes, and restarts

**Verify it's working:**
1. Configure your bot using slash commands in Discord
2. Check Railway logs - you should see "Saved configurations to Railway Volume!"
3. Restart your Railway service manually
4. Check logs again - you should see "Loaded configurations from: /app/data/config.json"
5. Your bot should still have all configurations without reconfiguring

### Get Your Railway URL:

1. Go to "Settings" tab in Railway
2. Scroll to "Domains"
3. Click "Generate Domain"
4. Copy the URL (example: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app`)

Your bot is now live 24/7 on Railway!

## Step 3: Monitor with UptimeRobot

UptimeRobot will ping your bot every 5 minutes to ensure it stays online.

### Setup UptimeRobot:

1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com and create a free account
2. Click "Add New Monitor"
3. Configure monitor:
   - **Monitor Type**: HTTP(s)
   - **Friendly Name**: Discord Role Guardian Bot
   - **URL**: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health`
   - **Monitoring Interval**: 5 minutes
   - **Alert Contacts**: Your email

4. Click "Create Monitor"

UptimeRobot will now:
- Ping your bot every 5 minutes
- Keep it awake 24/7
- Email you if the bot goes down
- Provide uptime statistics

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

Test your health check endpoint:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "bot": "YourBotName#1234",
  "uptime": 12345,
  "servers": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "storage": {
    "configured": true,
    "dataPath": "/app/data"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Configure Bot Features

After deployment, configure your bot using Discord slash commands:

### Setup Reaction Roles
```
/setup-reaction-roles
message-id: [message ID]
emoji: 👍
role: @Member
```

### Setup Welcome Messages
```
/setup-welcome
channel: #welcome
message: Welcome {user} to the server!
color: #00ff00
```

### Setup Leave Messages
```
/setup-leave
channel: #goodbye
message: {user} has left the server
color: #ff0000
```

### Setup Leveling System
```
/setup-leveling
announcement-channel: #level-ups
xp-per-message: 15
xp-cooldown: 60
```

### Add Level Roles
```
/add-level-role
level: 10
role: @Active Member
```

### Schedule Messages
```
/schedule-message
  name: announcement
  channel: #announcements
  type: One-time
  time: 14:30
  timezone-offset: +6
  message: Important announcement at 2:30 PM!
```

**Important Notes:**
- All setup commands require Administrator permissions
- Public commands like `/rank` and `/leaderboard` work for all members
- XP is tracked per-server (multi-server support built-in)
- Scheduled messages use UTC timezone
- Dynamic status shows what the bot is doing in real-time

## Automatic Deployments

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated features"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically:
1. Pull latest code from GitHub
2. Build and deploy
3. Restart the bot with zero downtime

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting

Check Railway logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. View "Deployments" tab
4. Check logs for errors

### Environment Variables Missing

Verify in Railway:
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Ensure `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` are set
3. Redeploy if you added variables

### Health Check Failing

Test locally first:
```bash
npm start
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Bot Loses Configuration After Restart

**This means Railway Volume is NOT configured!**

Fix:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Add Volume with mount path `/app/data`
3. Redeploy the service
4. Reconfigure bot with slash commands
5. Test by restarting - configurations should persist

### Check Storage Status

You can verify storage is working by checking the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

Look for the `storage` field in the response:
```json
{
  "storage": {
    "configured": true,
    "dataPath": "/app/data"
  }
}
```

If `dataPath` shows "local" instead of "/app/data", the volume is not mounted correctly.
