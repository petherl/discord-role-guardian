/**
 * Cleanup Script - Remove Duplicate Guild Commands
 * Run this once to remove old guild-specific commands that cause duplicates in Discord clients.
 * This is only necessary if you previously registered guild-specific commands.
 * Without a GUILD_ID set, the script will not perform any deletions.
 * After running, delete the GUILD_ID from your environment variables to prevent future issues.
 * Note: It may take some time for Discord to reflect these changes due to caching.
 * Listen if you develop on multiple guilds to avoid this in the future.
 * My recommendation is to always use global commands unless you have a specific need for guild-specific ones.
 * Sometimes guild-specific commands are useful for testing, but they should be removed afterward.
 * Usage: node scripts/cleanup-duplicate-commands.js
